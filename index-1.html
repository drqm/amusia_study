<p>In this repository you will find the code used to run the experiment and analyze the data for an EEG project on mismatch negativity (MMN) responses in congenital amusia. The project addressed several questions. The main one, which is reported in study 1, was wheter amusic listeners are sensitive to the predictability of melodies. The stimuli were manipulated by changing their complexity and familiarity. Results informing other questions will be reported elsewhere. Data will be shared upon request.</p>
